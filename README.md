# NecroAssistance Discord Bot

### âš  Please note that an error occured with GIT and the commit history has been wiped completely from my local machine and GitHub, but the code that was committed with the *new* initial commit in this repo has the most stable, up to date working code - just without the previous commits. If you would like to see old old logic from the first days of the bot, it is in a private repo from when the bot was still using Discord.JS (before I ported the bot over to Eris).

The NecroAssistant Discord Bot is a bot that helps with custom VALORANT games, with a rudimentary private "match making" system for ranked, elo calculated play. Currently most commands are made with the single guild that an instance of the bot is in (my instance in my guild), so if you would like to use the code with all of the commands and logic - there will be guild-specific data that needs to be changed for use on other guilds.
